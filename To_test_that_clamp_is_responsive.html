	Comparing vw to px and rems:
	</h1>
	<p class="one_vw">
	My viewport width on my main screen is 1680px.<br/>
	With 1 rem=16 px <b>i.e. without resizing the html font to 62.5%</b>, my viewport is 1680px = 105rem.<br/>
	1vw is 1% of that, so 1.05rem, which is 16.8px.<br/>
	1vw is about the same thing as 1 rem.
	Check it out:

	<p class="one_vw">
	This paragraph is 1 vw. <br/>
	</p>
	<p class="sixteen_point_eight_px">
	This paragraph is 16.8 pixels.
	</p>
	<p class="one_pt_0_5_rem">
	This paragraph is 1.05 rem.
	</p>
	<p class="one_rem">
	This paragraph is 1 rem.
	</p>
	<p class="one_vw">
	So <b>without resizing the html font to 62.5%</b>, seeing things on my large screen, 1vw is a little larger than 1 rem.

	Look at the title with the clamp function. Notice that:<br/>
	- at full screen, it is the size of the preferred value. <br/>
	This is as expected: 2vw at full screen is smaller than 3rem, so the browser can go with the preferred value rather than the max one.
	<br/>
	- when you decrease the window's size:<br/>
	This is as expected.<br/>
	&nbsp;- at first it resizes just as the heading with the preferred value. <br/>
	&nbsp;- at some point it stops resizing: it remains the size of the min value heading (whereas the preferred value heading in vw keeps resizing).

	Look at the title with the clamp function. Notice that:<br/><br/>
	- at full screen:<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- it is not the size of the preferred value. <br/>
	This much is as expected: 3vw at full screen is smaller than 2rem, so we can expect that the browser won't display the preferred value.
	<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <b>IT IS LARGER THAN THE MAX VALUE.</b><br/>
	THAT is somewhat suprising. You'd expect the max value to be just that, and constrain the heading to no go larger than it is set.<br/>
	The issue must be that at full-desktop-screen, the max value here is smaller than the preferred value. So, at least it should not be a problem in practice.
